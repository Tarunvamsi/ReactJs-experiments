# Episode 1 : Inception

 - React Element at the end is a "**JAVASCRIPT OBJECT**"
 - Bring react into our application using **CDN(Content Delivery Network)** Links - order is mandatory for these script files , otherwise we will get react error 
 - 2 files - **React core , ReactDOM** 
 - render() method - put the DOM file to the browser
 - React.createElement()  takes 3 arguments 
 - 1) **tag** which we want t create
 - 2) **Object** ( pass the attributes like id)
 - 3) **childrenr**(what we want in that tag) 
 - 4) if multiple children pass it like an array 
 - When we use **root.render()** it will **replace** the content not append
 - React is a library , not a fullpledged frame work 
 - We are makung a  **large scale application** using this library
 - The most **costliest operation** in web browsers is **DOM Manipulation**
